In this blog you can find and understand the differences between inline and block-level elemnts in HTML, you can also find which tags belong to each one.

## Block-level Elements

This tipe of element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after and also it always takes up the full width available.

Two commonly used block elements are:

- The `<p>` element defines a paragraph.
- The `<div>` defines a division, is often used as a container for other HTML elements, it does no requir attributes, but style, class and id are common.

Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

```
<address>       <article>       <aside>       <blockquote>       <canvas>       <dd>       <div>       <dl>  

<dt>           <fieldset>     <figcaption>      <figure>         <footer>      <form>      <h1>       -<h6>     

<header>          <hr>           <li>            <main>            <nav>      <noscript>   <ol>        <p>    

<pre>           <section>       <table>         <tfoot>            <ul>        <video>

```

## Inline Elements

An inline element does not start on a new line and just takes up as much width as necessary.

For expmple the `<span>` is used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document, it commond to give them atributes like style, class and id.

Here are the inline elements in HTML:

```
<a>       <abbr>       <acronym>       <b>       <bdo>       <big>       <br>       <button>       <cite>

<code>     <dfn>         <em>          <i>       <img>      <input>      <kbd>      <label>         <map>

<object>  <output>        <q>         <samp>    <script>    <select>    <small>      <span>       <strong>

<sub>      <sup>       <textarea>     <time>      <tt>       <var>
```


*You can have an inline in a block, but you can't have a block inside a inline, those are rules of html, so they are coded that way.*
